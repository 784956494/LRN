# Lorentzian-Residual-Neural-Networks

This repo contains the implementation for Lorentzian Residual Neural Networks. 

## Organization
* For our implementation on homophilous graphs for LRN in GNN, see the **homophilous** folder. 
* For the implementation of LRN in GNN on heterophilic graphs and LRN in graph transformer, see the **hetrophilic** folder.
